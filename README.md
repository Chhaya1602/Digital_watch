# Digital_watch
In this Javascript Miniproject, I create a Digirtal Clock which are useful elements for any UI if used in a proper way. Clocks can be used on sites where time is the main concern like some booking sites or some apps showing arriving times of trains, buses, flights, etc.  In this project I create a digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
